Your presentations should go here. Please commit them in a portable format (ideally PDF). You don't have to put them here before your presentation, but I encourage you to do so to market the talks for other interested people (especially on Twitter). We will also compile the feedback we collect from your peers (anonymously) in this repo.

You can of course use this git repo to store your presentations while youâ€™re working on them so that your work is safely maintained somewhere.

For some guidelines on how to create good academic presentations, you can consult the links available @ http://bit.ly/sastud-presentation-guidlines
